I'll make these docs more legit later, I promise

## To get started:

- Initiate ASL Bot in your Slack
- Pull your API Key
- Create a `.env` file
- Store that in your `.env` as `API_KEY`
- Run `node index.js`
- Message ASL Bot
- You should see a gif that searches for that word or serves a random gif if you say random

## Functionality

- `@asl-bot <word>`: Searches for that word in ASL under the "Sign with Robert" account
- `@asl-bot random`: Random ASL word
