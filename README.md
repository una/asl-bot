This is a WIP â€” I'll make these docs more legit later, I promise

## To get started:

- This uses a public Giphy API key for testing so no need to set up any environments for variables there
- Run `node index.js`
- Message ASL Bot
  - Set up a slash command in Slack
  - Set this app up on a server
  - Direct the slash command to `<url-for-app>/post`
- Once this is set up, you can type `/asl <word>` and see a gif of that in ASL from Sign with Robert
  - Warning: works *most* of the time with common words but not all of the time
